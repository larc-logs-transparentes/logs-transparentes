# Election Transparency - Monitoring Brazilian Elections with Transparent Logs
Merkle tree-based system to improve transparency and auditability of elections.

## Overview

This prototype is applied to the Brazilian election. It transparently stores election critical information, such as logs and "Boletins de Urna" (the result from each polling station). Thus any user can verify their integrity.
